### [4.0.4](https://github.com/Foo-Foo-MQ/foo-foo-mq/compare/v4.0.3...v4.0.4) (2020-07-12)


### Bug Fixes

### [4.0.3](https://github.com/Foo-Foo-MQ/foo-foo-mq/compare/v4.0.2...v4.0.3) (2020-06-26)

### Warning

This version `4.0.3` had an unintentional bug as a result of moving away from the deprecated url.parse to the URL class.
As a result, only consumers that were passing in a `uri` with credentials for connection containing were being ignored, and were defaulting back to `guest:guest` for `username:password`.  

Consumers providing separate keys for `user` and `pass` were not affected by this. This is fixed in `v4.0.4`
