## Additional Learning Resources

### Watch Me Code
Thanks to Derick Bailey's input, the API and documentation for rabbot have improved a lot.
You can learn from Derick's hands-on experience in his [Watch Me Code] series.

### RabbitMQ In Action
Alvaro Vidella and Jason Williams literally wrote the book on [RabbitMQ].

### Enterprise Integration Patterns
Gregor Hophe and Bobby Woolf's definitive work on messaging.
The [site][EIP Site] provides basic descriptions of the patterns
and the [book][EIP Book] goes into a lot of detail.

I can't recommend this book highly enough; understanding the patterns will provide you with the conceptual tools need to be successful.
